# Rockette Documentation

## Summary

Rockette is a C++ application that is intended to be used as a starting point when developing graphical applications for embedded systems. It simplifies development, as it's already configured to be built and run on Windows/Linux/macOS with minimal effort, and already includes basic components for text rendering, texture loading and receiving data from other applications.

You are still expected to write the C++ rendering code and to use OpenGL by yourself, but all the basic plumbing has been taken care of.

It uses:

- SDL2 as a multi-platform media layer abstraction
- OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering
- Basic gRPC integration to receive data from other applications
- ANGLE to emulate the OpenGL ES 2.0 when running on Windows/Linux/macOS
- FreeType to load TTF/OTF fonts
- Bazel for compilation

## Implementation

The implementation is intended to be just scaffolding. The available classes and methods are intended to be readable and easy to understand, so they can be easily modified.

The `src/main.cpp` file has the entry point and rendering/event processing loop, and also where the gRPC service `RocketteService` is instantiated.

Rendering happens on `Scene` objects, that are expected to implement the interface described in the `src/Scene.hpp`.

The `Renderer` class has methods to perform basic rendering operations, like rendering text, or an image.

The received RPC calls are handled by the `RocketteService` class, which stores received data in `std::map`s that can be easily accessed, as the `RocketteService` instance is passed to all scenes by default.

### Scenes

Scenes can be queued up in the `main` function, and will be executed as they complete (when a scene `update()` call returns `false`).

The `renderFixed()` method is intended to be used to render fixed elements to a framebuffer to be reused in all other frames.

The `render()` method is expected to contain the rendering code, responsible to render the frames to be displayed.

The `update(float delta)` method is expected to contain the event handling and update logic. The `delta` parameter represents the number of seconds that passed since the last processed frame.

## Text loading / rendering

Font parsing/loading is done by FreeType. OTF/TTF fonts are supported. For performance, font characters are rendered on a texture atlas, so only one texture is used when rendering multiple characters.

### Step 1: Loading the font face

You should use the static method  `FontWrapper::loadFontFace()` to load a font face, giving it an ID so you can reuse it later.

Example:
```
FontWrapper::loadFontFace(_r, "myfontface", "rkt/etc/fonts/my_font.otf");
```

### Step 2: Creating the font texture atlas

When creating a font texture atlas, you should indicate which characters you intend to render. This allows you to save video memory, by just adding to the atlas the characters you intend to use.

```
std::vector<FT_ULong> largeChars = {
    'N','0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','-','.'
};

int fontSize = 150;

FontWrapper *textHuge = new FontWrapper("myfontface", fontSize, largeChars);
```

### Step 3: Rendering text

The `Renderer` class already has an implementation for text rendering.

```
float renderText(FontWrapper &font, std::string text, GLfloat x, GLfloat y, GLfloat scale, glm::vec3 color, uint hAlign = LEFT, uint vAlign = BOTTOM)
```

It returns the X coordinate of the end of the rendered string.  
Allowed values for hAlign: `{LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT}`.  
Allowed values for vAlign: `{TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM}`.

Example:
```
_r->renderText(textHuge, "HelloWorld", 100.0f, 200.0f, 1.0f, glm::vec3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f));
```

## Texture loading / rendering

Only 32-bit TGA are supported. You should use the static method:

```
GLuint Texture::loadTGA(std::string path);
```

To load your texture. Example:


```
GLuint arcTexture = Texture::loadTGA("rkt/etc/textures/radial.tga");
```

Then, to render the texture, use the `Renderer` method:

```
void renderTexture(GLuint textureId, GLfloat x, GLfloat y, GLfloat width, GLfloat height, bool flipY = false, bool defaultProgram = true);
```

Example:

```
_r->renderTexture(arcTexture, 0, 0, 800.0f, 480.0f);
```

## Shader Programs

There are already primitives in place to compile/use shader programs easily.

### Loading/compiling a shader
```
RawShaderProgram *myCustomProgram = new RawShaderProgram( "rkt/etc/shaders/myCustomVertexProgram.glsl", "rkt/etc/shaders/myCustomFragmentProgram.glsl" );
```

### Using a shader program

When using OpenGL calls directly, you should use the `Renderer::useProgram()` method when setting the shader program, otherwise you may have undesirable effects when using other `Renderer` methods.

You can use the `ShaderProgram::getUniformLocation()` method to get uniform identifiers.

If you want to render a texture using a custom shader, you can configure your shader and textures manually, then call `_r->renderRect(posx, posy, width, height, flipY);` to render a rectangle to the screen with default UV coordinates `(0,0)->(1,1)`.

You can also set what shader to use by default when rendering text by using the `Renderer::setTextProgram()` method.


## Framebuffers

Sometimes you may want to render things to a texture, instead of rendering it to the screen. For that, you can use framebuffer utilities on the `Renderer` class:

```void createFramebuffer(GLuint &frameBuffer, GLuint &texture, GLuint width, GLuint height);```

This method will create a new framebuffer and texture with dimensions `width`x`height`, and assign the values to `frameBuffer` and `texture `.

Then you can use:

```void bindFramebuffer(GLuint frameBuffer);```

To set which framebuffer to use. Framebuffer `0` is the one bound to the screen.


## RPC

The `RocketteService` class is the class responsible for handling the RPC calls triggered by external applications. The default implementation has methods for receiving `int`, `float`, `string` and `bytes` from external applications. The `RocketteService` methods and parameters are defined in `src/proto/rkt.proto`.

For example, you can have an external Python application calling remotely the `UpdateIntData()` method, with identifier `hello` and value `10`. This will store the value `10` in a map, that can be retrieved from the `RocketteService` instance through the `RocketteService::getIntValue()` method.
